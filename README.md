ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn in a banking system using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer behavior, we can identify potential churners and take proactive measures to retain them.

ðŸ“Š Dataset Information

The dataset contains customer information such as demographics, account details, transaction history, and churn status. Key features include:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer

CreditScore: Credit rating of the customer

Geography: Country of residence

Gender: Male or Female

Age: Customer's age

Balance: Bank account balance

NumOfProducts: Number of bank products used

IsActiveMember: Whether the customer is an active user

Exited: Target variable (1 = Churned, 0 = Retained)

ðŸš€ Models & Performance

I experimented with multiple machine learning models to identify the best-performing one for churn prediction:

Logistic Regression: Baseline model

Random Forest: Improved accuracy through ensemble learning

ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaways

Features like Age, Balance, and NumOfProducts had a strong influence on churn.

The model can help banks identify at-risk customers and take preventive actions.
